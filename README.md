# Pitt Connect
**A SteelHacks 2021 project.**

## **Description**

D﻿uring COVID-19, all coursework at the University of Pittsburgh was administered online. This came with it a heap of class resource links for things like zoom meetings, tophat, gradescope, and others. Each professor stored these links in different places making them difficult to find and manage. So we created Pitt Connect as a part of Steelhacks 2021 which is a web app that manages all your course links for you and shares them with other students at the university.
